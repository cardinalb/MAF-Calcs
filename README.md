Quick Go program to calculate minimum allele frequencies across large SNP datasets. In this case for the barley 50K SNP chip developed at the James Hutton Institute/International Barley Hub but may be useful for anyone with data in a similar format.

Data needs to be in markersxlines format. If your data is in the other orientation use something like datamash (https://www.gnu.org/software/datamash/) to transpose the file.
